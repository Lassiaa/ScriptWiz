I’m the new girl so no making\n         fun of me.\n\n Her co-workers whistle and cheer her on. She takes a deep\n breath as the opening bars of “Born to Run” begin to play and\n Summer starts to sing. Tom sees Summer as the actress in\n whatever nonsensical karaoke video accompanies the song (it’s\n something to do with an old convertible, the sunset, and a\n midget in a tuxedo.)\n\n LATER.\n\n Tom sits in the booth with McKenzie (doing a shot) as Summer\n chats with co-workers at another table. Tom can’t help but\n stare at Summer. She notices and waves. He smiles, hopeful\n that she’ll come over. She doesn’t. He hides his\n disappointment.\n\n LATER.\n\n Tom walks back to his table with drinks. Summer is there in\n mid-conversation with McKenzie.\n\n                           TOM\n         You were great up there, by the\n         way.\n\n                           SUMMER\n         Well you can’t go wrong with The\n         Boss.\n\n                           TOM\n                  (sitting down)\n         I hear that.\n\n                           MCKENZIE\n         Hey, did you know Tom here’s from\n         Jersey?\n\n         Yeah?

A whistle blows and\n Rachel comes back and sits down.\n\n                         RACHEL\n       You were saying?\n\n                         TOM\n       My thinking is why rock the boat?\n       Things are going well. If we start\n       putting labels on it, that’s like\n       the kiss of death. Like saying to a\n       girl “I love you.”\n\n                         RACHEL\n       I know what you mean. That’s what\n       happened with me and Sean.\n\n                         TOM\n       Who the hell’s Sean?\n\n                         RACHEL\n       My boyfriend before Mark.\n\n                         TOM\n       Who the f--!

Oh my god. We can’t talk\n during this song. It’s too\n beautiful.\n\n And it is. Tom’s hand is on the gear shift. She puts hers\n there and locks it with his. Tom listens and Tom watches\n Summer listening. There’s something about this moment, the\n way she sings along, the way her eyes close during certain\n notes, the way her smile rises and falls like she could cry\n at any minute from being overwhelmingly happy or just simply\n overwhelmed. Tom is powerless to stop his feelings for this\n girl.\n\n Marley sings:\n\n                B.M.\n [PAGE BREAK]\n                                                                                                         52.\n\n                   “In life I know there’s lots of\n                   grief/ but your love is my relief.”\n We know, as well as he does: he will ask nothing tonight.\n (172)\n",

I’m flattered, I’m\n                   just not interested. Now why don’t\n                   you go back over there and leave us\n                   alone, ok?\n\n                                     DOUCHE\n                   It’s a free country.\n Summer and Tom make eye contact again, as if to say “now\n what?” After a beat:\n\n                                     DOUCHE\n                   So you and him, huh? I can’t\n                   believe that. Is this guy really\n                   your boyfriend?\n And that question hangs in the air. Tom, panicked, decides to\n cut the silence. All the pent up uncertainty and confusion,\n coupled with the challenge to his manhood in front of the\n woman he loves, all manifests in one single, solid, almost\n automatic RIGHT CROSS TO THE GOOD LOOKING DOUCHEBAG’S FACE.\n Which connects spot on and sends the Douche reeling.\n Both Douche and Tom wince at the pain (Douche’s chin, Tom’s\n fist).\n There’s a beat of calm where Tom is actually sorta surprised.\n And then the Douche spins around and starts PUMMELLING TOM.\n\n                                                                                                 CUT TO:\n",

We met in          71.\n                   elementary school. We had the same   CUT TO:\n                   class schedule in the 7th grade and\n                   we just-- clicked.\n\n CU MCKENZIE.\n                                     MCKENZIE\n\n                   Love? Shit, I don’t know. As long\n                   as she’s cute and she’s willing,\n                   right? Actually, cute is a strong\n                   word. Not atrocious.\n CU RACHEL.\n\n                                     RACHEL\n                   That’s a pretty complex question.\n                   Philosophers, poets, scientists,\n                   everybody has a theory, don’t they?\n                   I kinda like what Nietzsche said:\n                   “There is always some madness in\n                   love, but there is also-- always\n                   some reason in madness.” Think\n                   about it. Pretty smart. Although,\n                   Nietzsche also said “Kill the\n                   Jews.” So there’s that.\n CU VANCE.\n\n                                     VANCE\n                   I’ve been happily married for 30\n                   years.

We’ve been fed this nonsense\n                   for generations to the point where\n                   it’s now genetically encoded in our\n                   very beings. And what does it mean?\n                   Absolutely nothing. Give me a\n                   break!\n CU MCKENZIE\n [PAGE BREAK]\n                                                                                                         72.\n\n                                     MCKENZIE\n                   I’m just saying-- I really need\n                   some ass.
